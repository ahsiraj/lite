<h2> Prelude & About Me</h2>
<p>
Engineering college faculty since 1999. Prior to that, was in industry and and in some other academic stint. Ever since joined as engineering faculty, was making use the Internet and internet. Had a short term faculty training course about Internet and related technology in 1999 at NIT Calicut. That gave me a clear footing to build up on this area. Since then it was passion to set up various servers like http, ftp, nntp, smtp etc. and internetworking through wired and wireless networks. And the only operating system familiar is Linux. Lead these activities around for about 10 years as part of my academic work. <br/><br/>

Subsequently  had gone back to passionate subject areas - Computability theory and Complexity theory. From the year 2001,  have been using web servers for all the student centric academic activities. The sites were static content based. But they served the purpose. The pages were very easily developed using Seamonkey composer, without much botheration about HTML tags. In this, myself indebted to Seamonkey project. You may say that the pages are dull devoid of images and beauty. But, it served the purpose very well. Meanwhile, wast majority of faculty are not using technology even to that extend.<br/><br/>

Here is the link to <a href="http://14.139.189.217/"> my present academic page </a> . Have a look. It is not meant for the public even though the contents are public. It is meant for my  students. <br/><br/>

We know, HTML, javascript, css, etc are not rocket technology. But it has its relevance and abundand opportunities for the young. Initially was a little sceptical about joining this Web based course. But, learning something so that the exposure so obtained being instrumental in shaping the career of many youngsters will be hugely satisfying. So, decidd to plunge in. Shall earnestly pursue it.
